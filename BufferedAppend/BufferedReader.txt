BufferedWriter is a character stream class in Java used to write text to a file efficiently.
It is part of the java.io package and is typically used for writing plain text files line by line.

By default, FileWriter (used inside BufferedWriter) overwrites the file content,
but if we want to append data instead of overwriting, we need to use the constructor with the append flag (true).

-> We can directly pass the file name and true as parameters for the FileWriter constructor
and then pass the FileWriter object to the BufferedWriter constructor.

Syntax:
    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("filename.txt", true);
    BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);

-> Else we can pass the File object and true as parameters for the FileWriter constructor
and then pass the FileWriter object to the BufferedWriter constructor.

Syntax:
    File f = new File("filename.txt");
    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(f, true);
    BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);

The BufferedWriter writes characters to the file using the write() method
and adds a new line with the newLine() method.

If the file does not exist, FileWriter will create a new file.
By default, FileWriter overwrites the file, but if opened in append mode,
it will add the new data to the existing data in the file.
