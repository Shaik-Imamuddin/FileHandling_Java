FileReader is a character stream class in Java used to read data from a text file character by character.
It is part of the java.io package and is typically used for reading plain text files.

->we can directly pass the file name as a parameter for FileReader constructor while creating object

Syntax:
    FileReader fr = new FileReader("filename.txt");

->else we can pass the File class object as a parameter for FileReader constructor
Syntax:
    File f = new File("filename.txt");
    FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);

The file reader will read charecter by charecter from the file through read() method

read() -> will returns the unicode of the each and every charecter,
          If there is no charecters found it will returns -1 .

Note : If you are using Filereader then the file needs to be exist , else it will raise FileNotFoundException
