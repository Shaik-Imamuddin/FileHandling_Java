BufferedReader is a character stream class in Java used to read text from a character-based input stream efficiently.
It is part of the java.io package and is commonly used to read text line by line from a file.


->We can directly pass the file name as a parameter for the FileReader constructor 
and then pass FileReader object to BufferedReader constructor while creating an object.

Syntax:
    FileReader fr = new FileReader("filename.txt");
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);

->Else we can pass the File class object as a parameter to the FileReader constructor and then  
pass the FileReader object to BufferedReader constructor while creating an object to BufferedReader.

Syntax:
    File f = new File("filename.txt");
    FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr);


The BufferedReader reads text from a character-based input stream efficiently by buffering characters.

It uses the read() method to read a single character or an array of characters 
and the readLine() method to read one line at a time.

If the file does not exist, FileReader will throw a FileNotFoundException.
