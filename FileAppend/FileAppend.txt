FileWriter is a character stream class in Java used to write data to a text file character by character.
It is part of the java.io package and is typically used for writing plain text files.

By default, FileWriter overwrites the file content, but if we want to append data instead of overwriting,
we need to use the constructor with the append flag (true).

->We can directly pass the file name and true as parameters for the FileWriter constructor while creating an object.

Syntax:
    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("filename.txt", true);

->Else we can pass the File class object and true as parameter for the FileWriter constructor.

    File f = new File("filename.txt");
    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(f, true);


The FileWriter writes characters to the file using the write() method.

If the file does not exist, FileWriter will create a new file.
By default, FileWriter overwrites the existing content in the file.
if you opened in the Append mode it will add the new data to existing data in the file
