BufferedWriter is a character stream class in Java used to write text to a file efficiently.
It is part of the java.io package and is commonly used to write text line by line.

-> We can directly pass the file name as a parameter to the FileWriter constructor
and then pass the FileWriter object to the BufferedWriter constructor.

Syntax:
    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("filename.txt");
    BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);

-> Else we can pass a File object to the FileWriter constructor and then
pass the FileWriter object to the BufferedWriter constructor.

File f = new File("filename.txt");
FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(f);
BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);

The BufferedWriter writes text efficiently by buffering characters.
It uses the write() method to write text and the newLine() method to add a new line.

If the file does not exist, FileWriter will create a new file.
By default, it overwrites the existing content unless opened in append mode Refer BufferedAppened for Append code.
