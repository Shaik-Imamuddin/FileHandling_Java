FileWriter is a character stream class in Java used to write data to a text file character by character.
It is part of the java.io package and is typically used for writing plain text files.

->We can directly pass the file name as a parameter for the FileWriter constructor while creating an object.

Syntax:
    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("filename.txt");

->Else we can pass the File class object as a parameter for the FileWriter constructor.

    File f = new File("filename.txt");
    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(f);

The FileWriter writes characters to the file using the write() method.

If the file does not exist, FileWriter will create a new file.
By default, FileWriter overwrites the existing content in the file.
